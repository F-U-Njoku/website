# Fortune Uchechukwu Njoku

Hello! I'm a Data Science & Engineering professional with a strong foundation in machine learning, data engineering, and AI research. My journey, highlighted by a Ph.D. in Data Engineering from UPC and ULB, has been focused on developing and deploying scalable ML systems, from data ingestion and preprocessing to production deployment and monitoring.  I specialize in optimizing machine learning pipelines, feature selection, and designing robust data architectures, with practical experience in tools like Python, SQL, Spark, and Google Cloud.  From leading the development of data space demonstrators to applying advanced ML techniques for real-world impact, I'm dedicated to pushing the boundaries of AI, particularly in generative AI and large language models.
